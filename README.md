# US Fair Use Legal Outcome Analysis
Purpose: To create a supervised machine learning model to predict the outcome of fair use legal cases and investigate issues in the construction of similar models. 

In this project, a variety of machine learning models were experimented with such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, SVM, and XG Boost. Ultimately, the XGBoost model resulted in the highest predictive probability of 60%.
